# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ant-quic codebase has grown significantly and now requires a thorough cleanup and refactoring to achieve a production-ready, minimal, and highly modular implementation. The goal is to create a super clean codebase focused exclusively on QUIC-native NAT traversal using raw public keys for authentication, removing unnecessary features and ensuring exceptional test coverage, particularly for cross-platform network interface detection and connection management.

This refactoring effort will transform the current comprehensive but complex codebase into a streamlined, maintainable, and thoroughly tested implementation that serves as the foundation for reliable P2P networking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Codebase Simplification and Modularization

4. WHEN reviewing interfaces THEN the system SHALL have clean, well-defined APIs between modules
5. WHEN examining the build system THEN the system SHALL have minimal feature flags focused only on essential functionality

### Requirement 2: Focus on Core QUIC-Native NAT Traversal

**User Story:** As a P2P application developer, I want a focused implementation that provides only the essential QUIC-native NAT traversal functionality, so that I can rely on a stable, well-tested core without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL implement only the QUIC-native approach from draft-seemann-quic-nat-traversal-01
2. WHEN examining protocols THEN the system SHALL NOT include STUN, ICE, or other external NAT traversal protocols

4. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL provide a minimal, focused interface for P2P connection establishment
5. WHEN examining the implementation THEN the system SHALL use only the three required QUIC extension frames (ADD_ADDRESS, PUNCH_ME_NOW, REMOVE_ADDRESS)

### Requirement 3: Raw Public Key Authentication Only

**User Story:** As a P2P network participant, I want authentication based exclusively on raw public keys without the complexity of X.509 certificate infrastructure, so that the system is simpler and more suitable for decentralized networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL use only RFC 7250 Raw Public Key authentication
2. WHEN configuring endpoints THEN the system SHALL NOT require X.509 certificate support unless explicitly needed for backward compatibility
3. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL use Ed25519 keys in SubjectPublicKeyInfo format exclusively
4. WHEN managing peer identity THEN the system SHALL derive peer IDs directly from public keys
5. WHEN reviewing crypto code THEN the system SHALL remove unnecessary certificate handling complexity

### Requirement 4: Exceptional Cross-Platform Network Interface Detection Testing

**User Story:** As a developer deploying on multiple platforms, I want comprehensive test coverage for network interface detection across Windows, Linux, and macOS, so that I can be confident the system works reliably in all target environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing on Windows THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive tests for IP Helper API integration with various network configurations
2. WHEN testing on Linux THEN the system SHALL have extensive tests for Netlink socket interface discovery across different distributions
3. WHEN testing on macOS THEN the system SHALL have thorough tests for System Configuration framework integration
4. WHEN running cross-platform tests THEN the system SHALL validate interface discovery behavior in dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 environments
5. WHEN examining test coverage THEN network interface detection SHALL have >95% code coverage with edge case testing

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Connection Management Testing

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want extensive testing of connection lifecycle management, so that I can deploy the system with confidence in its reliability and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing connection establishment THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive tests for all NAT traversal scenarios
2. WHEN testing connection failures THEN the system SHALL have extensive error handling and recovery testing
3. WHEN testing concurrent connections THEN the system SHALL validate behavior under high load with multiple simultaneous connections
4. WHEN testing connection migration THEN the system SHALL thoroughly test QUIC path switching after successful NAT traversal
5. WHEN examining test coverage THEN connection management SHALL have >95% code coverage including error paths

### Requirement 6: Minimal Dependencies and Build Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer integrating ant-quic, I want minimal dependencies and a simple build configuration, so that integration is straightforward and the attack surface is reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN the system SHALL include only essential crates required for core functionality
2. WHEN examining feature flags THEN the system SHALL have a minimal set of features focused on platform differences and crypto providers
3. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL compile quickly with minimal external dependencies
4. WHEN analyzing the dependency tree THEN the system SHALL avoid transitive dependencies that are not essential
5. WHEN reviewing Cargo.toml THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation for each dependency's purpose

### Requirement 7: Clean API Design and Documentation

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want a clean, well-documented API that makes P2P networking straightforward, so that I can focus on application logic rather than low-level networking details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the high-level API THEN the system SHALL provide simple, intuitive methods for P2P connection establishment
2. WHEN reading documentation THEN each public API SHALL have comprehensive documentation with examples
3. WHEN examining the API surface THEN the system SHALL expose only necessary functionality and hide implementation details
4. WHEN using error handling THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages with recovery suggestions
5. WHEN reviewing examples THEN the system SHALL include practical usage examples for common scenarios

### Requirement 8: Performance and Resource Optimization

**User Story:** As a system deploying ant-quic in production, I want optimized performance and minimal resource usage, so that the system can handle high loads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring memory usage THEN the system SHALL use minimal memory for connection state and candidate management
2. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL establish connections quickly with minimal overhead
3. WHEN examining resource cleanup THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources when connections are closed
4. WHEN testing under load THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with hundreds of concurrent connections
5. WHEN profiling the code THEN the system SHALL have no memory leaks or resource accumulation over time

### Requirement 9: Security Hardening and Validation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want a hardened implementation with comprehensive security validation, so that the system is resistant to attacks and abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria
