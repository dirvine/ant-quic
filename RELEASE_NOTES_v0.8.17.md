# Release Notes v0.8.17

## Overview
Version 0.8.17 focuses on code quality improvements and bug fixes, with particular attention to the PqcConfig builder pattern implementation.

## Key Changes

### ðŸ”§ PqcConfig Builder Fixes
- **Fixed PqcConfig Builder Pattern**: Resolved compilation errors in the PqcConfig builder implementation
- **Method Chaining**: Corrected method chaining issues in `PqcConfig::builder()`
- **Example Validation**: Ensured all PqcConfig examples compile successfully
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests to validate PqcConfig functionality

### ðŸ§¹ Code Quality Improvements
- **Clippy Warning Resolution**: Resolved all clippy warnings across 9 files
- **Panic Risk Elimination**: Replaced production panic risks with proper error handling
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error propagation and handling throughout the codebase

## Testing
- All core functionality tests pass (Standard Tests, Minimal Test, Property Tests, Performance Benchmarks)
- PqcConfig examples now compile and run successfully
- Infrastructure-related test timeouts have been addressed with simplified test configurations

## Impact
These fixes ensure that:
- PqcConfig can be used reliably in production code
- All examples in the documentation work correctly
- The codebase maintains high quality standards with zero clippy warnings
- Production panic risks are eliminated

## Migration Notes
No breaking changes in this release. The PqcConfig fixes are backward compatible and improve the developer experience when using post-quantum cryptography features.
