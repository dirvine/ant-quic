# Introduction

Welcome to the ant-quic documentation!

ant-quic is a QUIC transport protocol implementation with advanced NAT traversal capabilities, optimized for P2P networks and the Autonomi ecosystem. It extends the proven Quinn QUIC implementation with sophisticated hole-punching protocols to achieve near 100% connectivity through restrictive NATs.

## Key Features

- **Advanced NAT Traversal**: Implementation of draft-seemann-quic-nat-traversal-01
- **High Performance**: Built on top of the battle-tested Quinn QUIC implementation
- **P2P Optimized**: Designed for decentralized peer-to-peer networks
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, Linux, macOS, and WebAssembly
- **Secure by Default**: Ed25519 authentication and TLS 1.3
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive test suite with 580+ tests

## Who is this for?

- **P2P Application Developers**: Build decentralized applications with reliable connectivity
- **Network Engineers**: Deploy QUIC-based services with NAT traversal
- **Researchers**: Experiment with modern transport protocols
