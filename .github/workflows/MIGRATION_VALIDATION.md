# CI Workflow Consolidation - Migration Validation Checklist

## Overview
This document tracks the consolidation of `ci.yml` and `rust.yml` workflows into a single comprehensive CI workflow.

## Migration Status
- [x] Backed up original `ci.yml` to `ci-backup.yml`
- [x] Renamed `rust.yml` to `rust-legacy.yml`  
- [x] Created consolidated `ci.yml` with all functionality
- [x] Verified no hardcoded references to old workflow names
- [ ] Tested in production environment

## Feature Coverage Validation

### From Original ci.yml
- [x] Basic lint checks (fmt, clippy)
- [x] Test on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- [x] ARM64 cross-compilation
- [x] Code coverage reporting
- [x] Release builds

### From rust.yml
- [x] Security audit with cargo-deny
- [x] Beta Rust channel testing
- [x] Weekly scheduled runs
- [x] BSD variants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, Illumos)
- [x] WASM target testing
- [x] Android emulator testing
- [x] MSRV (1.74.1) verification
- [x] Feature powerset testing
- [x] AWS LC crypto provider testing
- [x] Documentation build checks

### Improvements in Consolidated Version
- [x] Job dependencies for fail-fast behavior
- [x] Better job naming for clarity
- [x] Continue-on-error for flaky platforms
- [x] Consolidated coverage job
- [x] Success marker job for branch protection

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-merge Testing
1. [ ] Push to feature branch and verify all jobs trigger
2. [ ] Confirm lint failures stop subsequent jobs
3. [ ] Verify matrix expansion works correctly
4. [ ] Check job duration compared to previous runs
5. [ ] Ensure all status checks appear in PR

### Post-merge Monitoring (First Week)
1. [ ] Daily: Check for unexpected failures
2. [ ] Weekly: Verify scheduled run triggers on Friday
3. [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions usage/minutes
4. [ ] Collect feedback from contributors
5. [ ] Check if any integration issues arise

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Rename `ci.yml` to `ci-consolidated.yml`
2. Restore `ci-backup.yml` to `ci.yml`
3. Restore `rust-legacy.yml` to `rust.yml`
4. Update branch protection rules

## Performance Metrics
Track these metrics before/after consolidation:
- Average CI runtime: ___ minutes
- GitHub Actions minutes used per week: ___
- Failure rate by platform: ___
- Time to first failure (fail-fast effectiveness): ___

## Notes
- BSD platform tests are set to continue-on-error due to occasional runner issues
- Android tests have 30-minute timeout due to emulator startup time
- Coverage only runs after core tests pass to save resources
- The `ci-success` job simplifies branch protection rule configuration
