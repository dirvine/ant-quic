## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install the binary
cargo install ant-quic

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/autonomi/ant-quic
cd ant-quic
cargo build --release
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run as P2P node with QUIC protocol
ant-quic --listen 0.0.0.0:9000

# Connect to bootstrap nodes for peer discovery (automatic connection on startup)
ant-quic --bootstrap node1.example.com:9000,node2.example.com:9000

# Run as coordinator with NAT traversal event monitoring
ant-quic --force-coordinator --listen 0.0.0.0:9000

# Run with dashboard for real-time statistics
ant-quic --dashboard --listen 0.0.0.0:9000

# Run multiple nodes locally for testing
ant-quic --listen 0.0.0.0:9000 # Bootstrap node
ant-quic --listen 0.0.0.0:9001 --bootstrap 127.0.0.1:9000 # Client node

# Check NAT traversal status while running
# Type /status to see discovered addresses and coordination sessions
# Type /help for available commands
```

### How It Works

ant-quic automatically detects its network reachability and adapts its role:

- **Public IP + Reachable**: Becomes full coordinator providing bootstrap services to other nodes
- **Limited Reachability**: Provides limited coordinator services while also acting as client
- **Behind NAT**: Client-only mode, connects to others through NAT traversal

This creates a **decentralized bootstrap network** where any publicly reachable node automatically helps coordinate connections for nodes behind NATs.

### Library Usage

```rust
use ant_quic::{
    nat_traversal_api::{NatTraversalEndpoint, NatTraversalConfig, EndpointRole},
    CandidateSource, NatTraversalRole,
};

// Create NAT traversal endpoint (address discovery enabled by default)
let config = NatTraversalConfig {
    role: EndpointRole::Client,
    bootstrap_nodes: vec!["bootstrap.example.com:9000".parse().unwrap()],
    max_candidates: 8,
    coordination_timeout: Duration::from_secs(10),
    discovery_timeout: Duration::from_secs(5),
};

let endpoint = NatTraversalEndpoint::new(config).await?;

// Connect to peer through NAT traversal
let peer_id = PeerId([0x12; 32]);
let connection = endpoint.connect_to_peer(peer_id).await?;

// Access discovered addresses
let discovered = endpoint.discovered_addresses();
println!("Discovered addresses: {:?}", discovered);
```

### Configuration

#### Address Discovery Configuration

Address discovery is enabled by default and can be configured via:

```rust
use ant_quic::config::{EndpointConfig, AddressDiscoveryConfig};

let mut config = EndpointConfig::default();

// Configure address discovery
config.set_address_discovery_enabled(true);  // Default: true
config.set_max_observation_rate(30);         // Max 30 observations/second
config.set_observe_all_paths(false);         // Only observe active path

// Or use environment variables
// ANT_QUIC_ADDRESS_DISCOVERY_ENABLED=false
// ANT_QUIC_MAX_OBSERVATION_RATE=60
```

Bootstrap nodes automatically use aggressive observation settings:
- 5x higher observation rate (up to 315/second)
- Observe all paths regardless of configuration
- Immediate observation on new connections

### Examples

cargo run --example chat_demo -- --bootstrap node1.example.com:9000,node2.example.com:9000
cargo run --example dashboard_demo
cargo run --example address_discovery_demo
```

## Architecture

ant-quic extends the proven Quinn QUIC implementation with sophisticated NAT traversal capabilities:

### Core Components

- **Transport Parameter Extensions**: RFC-style negotiation of NAT traversal and address discovery
  - NAT Traversal Parameter (0x58): Negotiates NAT traversal capabilities
  - Address Discovery Parameter (0x1f00): Configures observation rates and behavior
- **Extension Frames**: Custom QUIC frames for address advertisement and coordination
  - `ADD_ADDRESS` (0xBAAD): Advertise candidate addresses
  - `PUNCH_ME_NOW` (0xBEEF): Coordinate simultaneous hole punching
  - `REMOVE_ADDRESS` (0xDEAD): Remove invalid candidates
  - `OBSERVED_ADDRESS` (0x43): Report observed peer addresses (IETF draft standard)
- **ICE-like Candidate Pairing**: Priority-based connection establishment
- **Round-based Coordination**: Synchronized hole punching protocol
- **Address Discovery Engine**: Automatic detection and notification of peer addresses

### NAT Traversal Process

1. **Candidate Discovery**: Enumerate local addresses and receive QUIC-observed addresses
2. **Bootstrap Coordination**: Connect to bootstrap nodes for peer discovery
3. **Address Advertisement**: Exchange candidate addresses with peers
4. **Priority Calculation**: Rank candidate pairs using ICE-like algorithms
5. **Coordinated Hole Punching**: Synchronized transmission to establish connectivity
6. **Path Validation**: Verify connection paths before promoting to active
7. **Connection Migration**: Adapt to network changes and path failures

### Address Discovery Process

1. **Connection Establishment**: Peers connect and negotiate address discovery support
2. **Address Observation**: Endpoints observe the source address of incoming packets
3. **Frame Transmission**: Send OBSERVED_ADDRESS frames to notify peers
4. **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm prevents observation flooding
5. **Change Detection**: Monitor for address changes and notify accordingly
6. **NAT Integration**: Discovered addresses automatically become NAT traversal candidates

### Network Topology Support

- **Full Cone NAT**: Direct connection establishment
- **Restricted Cone NAT**: Coordinated hole punching with address filtering
- **Port Restricted NAT**: Port-specific coordination protocols
- **Symmetric NAT**: Advanced prediction and multi-path establishment
- **Carrier Grade NAT (CGNAT)**: Relay-assisted connection fallback

## Specifications

ant-quic implements and extends the following IETF specifications and drafts:

### 1. QUIC Core Specification

  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-seemann-quic-nat-traversal/
