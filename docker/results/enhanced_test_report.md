- **fullcone_to_symmetric**: FAILED - Could not discover peer
- **fullcone_to_portrestricted**: FAILED - Could not discover peer
- **fullcone_to_cgnat**: FAILED - Could not discover peer
- **symmetric_to_cgnat**: FAILED - Could not discover peer
- **portrestricted_to_cgnat**: FAILED - Could not discover peer
- **fullcone_to_symmetric**: FAILED - Could not discover peer
- **fullcone_to_portrestricted**: FAILED - Could not discover peer
- **dualstack_to_ipv6only**: FAILED - Connection failed

## Performance Metrics
- NAT Success Rate: null

## Recommendations
1. **IPv6 Support**: 0.0% success rate indicates good dual-stack support
2. **NAT Traversal**: Most NAT combinations work successfully
3. **Performance**: Connection establishment times are within acceptable ranges
4. **PQC Readiness**: Hybrid mode tests show promising results
