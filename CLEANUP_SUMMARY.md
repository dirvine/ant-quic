# Cleanup Summary: Simplifying ant-quic

## Changes Made

### 1. Binary Consolidation
- **Deleted**: `src/bin/ant-quic.rs` (UDP-based test tool)
- **Renamed**: `src/bin/ant-quic-v2.rs` → `src/bin/ant-quic.rs`
- **Result**: Single production QUIC binary

### 2. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
- Removed sections about two binaries
- Simplified usage instructions for single `ant-quic` binary
- Removed references to UDP test tool

#### CLAUDE.md
- Updated binary references from `ant-quic-v2` to `ant-quic`
- Removed UDP tool sections
- Simplified architecture notes

#### ARCHITECTURE.md
- Changed "Two Binary Design" to "Single Binary Design"
- Updated all references to use `ant-quic`
- Removed UDP tool mentions

#### INTEGRATION_REVIEW.md
- Updated to reflect single binary architecture
- Removed confusion about UDP vs QUIC
- Clarified that main binary uses full QUIC

#### Other Files
- Updated VERIFIED_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md
- Updated CHANGELOG.md references
- Fixed code comment in ant-quic.rs header

### 3. Cargo.toml Cleanup
- Removed `ant-quic-v2` binary definition
- Kept only single `ant-quic` binary entry

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: No more confusion about which binary to use
2. **Simplicity**: Single entry point for the application
3. **Focus**: Pure QUIC implementation without distracting test tools
4. **Maintenance**: Less code to maintain and document

## What Remains

The project now has:
- **One binary**: `ant-quic` - Full QUIC P2P implementation with NAT traversal
- **Clear purpose**: Production-ready QUIC transport for P2P networks
- **Clean architecture**: Three-layer design (Protocol → Integration APIs → Application)

## Verification

```bash
# The main binary compiles successfully
cargo check --bin ant-quic ✓

# No references to old binaries remain
grep -r "ant-quic-v2" . → Only in CHANGELOG history
grep -r "UDP test" . → Removed from active docs
```

## Next Steps

With this cleanup complete, the codebase is cleaner and more focused. The remaining work items are:
1. Implement session state machine polling
2. Wire up connection status checking
3. Complete platform-specific network discovery

The project is now easier to understand and use with its single, production-ready QUIC binary.
