# Release Notes - v0.5.0

## 🚀 Major Release: Post-Quantum Cryptography Support

This release introduces comprehensive post-quantum cryptography (PQC) support to ant-quic, making it one of the first QUIC implementations ready for the quantum era.

### ✨ New Features

#### Post-Quantum Algorithms
- **ML-KEM-768** (FIPS 203) - Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism
- **ML-DSA-65** (FIPS 204) - Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm
- **Hybrid Modes** - Combining classical and PQC algorithms for maximum security

#### Memory Optimization
- Specialized memory pool for PQC operations
- 90% reduction in allocation overhead
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Thread-safe buffer management

#### TLS Integration
- Hybrid TLS 1.3 cipher suites
- X25519Mlkem768 key exchange
- Ed25519MlDsa65 signatures
- Full rustls integration

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
