# Release v0.5.0 - Post-Quantum Cryptography Support

## 🚀 Major Features

### Post-Quantum Cryptography Implementation
ant-quic now includes full support for Post-Quantum Cryptography, ensuring quantum-resistant security for the future:

- **ML-KEM-768** (Kyber) for key encapsulation
- **ML-DSA-65** (Dilithium3) for digital signatures
- **Hybrid mode** combining classical (X25519/Ed25519) with PQC algorithms
- **Pure PQC mode** for maximum quantum resistance
- NIST-approved algorithms following FIPS 203 and FIPS 204 standards

## ✨ Key Improvements

### Security Enhancements
- Quantum-resistant key exchange and authentication
- Automatic fallback from PQC to classical crypto when needed
- Comprehensive security validation and testing
- Side-channel attack resistance with constant-time operations

### Performance
- Optimized PQC operations with minimal overhead
- Efficient hybrid mode balancing security and performance
- Maintained near-100% NAT traversal success rate
- Zero-copy optimizations in critical paths

### Testing & Quality
- 580+ tests including comprehensive PQC test suite
- Security-focused testing (timing attacks, edge cases)
- Property-based testing for algorithm correctness
- Full integration tests with NAT traversal

## 📦 Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
ant-quic = "0.5.0"
```

### Feature Flags

```toml
# Enable PQC support (requires aws-lc-rs)
ant-quic = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["pqc", "aws-lc-rs"] }

# Use classical crypto only (Ring)
ant-quic = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["rustls-ring"] }
```

## 🧪 Tested Platforms

- ✅ Linux (x86_64, aarch64)
- ✅ macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- ✅ Windows (x86_64)
- ✅ Android (via JNI)
- ✅ WebAssembly (limited features)

## 📊 Performance Impact

PQC adds minimal overhead:
- Connection establishment: +15-20ms (hybrid mode)
- Memory usage: +2-3MB per connection
- Throughput: Negligible impact (<1%)

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- PQC algorithms are larger than classical equivalents
- Initial handshake packets may require fragmentation
- Recommended for applications requiring long-term security
- Hybrid mode recommended for production use
