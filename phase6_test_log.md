# Phase 6: Real-World Validation Test Log

## Test Environment

- **Bootstrap Node**: Digital Ocean instance (159.89.81.21:9000)
  - Location: NYC
  - OS: Ubuntu 24.04
  - ant-quic version: 0.4.4
  - Running as forced coordinator with dashboard

- **Client Node**: macOS local machine
  - Behind home router NAT
  - ant-quic version: 0.4.4 (built from source)

## Test 1: Home Network NAT Traversal

### Setup
- Bootstrap node started on DO: `./ant-quic --listen 0.0.0.0:9000 --force-coordinator --dashboard`
- Client connecting from home network

### Test Execution
Starting client connection at: 2025-07-24 19:52:00 UTC

```bash
cargo run --bin ant-quic -- --bootstrap 159.89.81.21:9000 --dashboard
```

### Results
✅ **Connection Successful**
- Client peer ID: 82c87deed97bf3edbd58d51635fc89d929358a5e8152f564152621fc5548fcc8
- Successfully connected to bootstrap node at 159.89.81.21:9000
- Bootstrap peer ID: a46e98c27a11584e
- NAT traversal capability negotiated successfully
- Dashboard showed 1 active connection with 100% success rate

### Key Observations
1. QUIC connection established immediately (< 200ms)
2. NAT traversal parameters negotiated correctly
3. Address discovery working - client discovered bootstrap's address
4. Connection remained stable for 30+ seconds
5. No packet loss or connection drops observed

## Test 2: Mobile Network NAT Traversal

### Setup
- Bootstrap node: Still running on DO (159.89.81.21:9000)
- Client: macOS machine using mobile hotspot/tethering
- Test time: 2025-07-24 20:00:00 UTC

### Test Execution
To test mobile network connectivity:
1. Enable Personal Hotspot on mobile device
2. Connect macOS to mobile hotspot
3. Run client connection test

```bash
cargo run --bin ant-quic -- --bootstrap 159.89.81.21:9000 --dashboard
```

### Results
⏳ **Test Pending** - Awaiting user execution with mobile hotspot

## Test 3: Enterprise Network (Strict Firewall)

### Setup
- Bootstrap node: DO instance (159.89.81.21:9000)
- Client: Behind corporate/enterprise firewall with restrictive policies
- Test for: CGNAT, symmetric NAT, restricted UDP

### Test Execution
```bash
cargo run --bin ant-quic -- --bootstrap 159.89.81.21:9000 --dashboard --debug
```

### Results
⏳ **Test Pending** - Requires enterprise network environment

## Test 4: Long-Running Stability Test

### Setup
- Bootstrap node: DO instance (159.89.81.21:9000)
- Client: Any network configuration
- Duration: 1+ hours continuous connection
- Monitor: Connection drops, memory usage, CPU usage

### Test Execution
```bash
# Start with monitoring
cargo run --bin ant-quic -- --bootstrap 159.89.81.21:9000 --dashboard > stability_test.log 2>&1 &
PID=$!

# Monitor resources
while true; do
    ps aux | grep $PID | grep -v grep >> resource_usage.log
    sleep 60
done
```

### Results
⏳ **Test Pending**

## Test 5: Multi-Bootstrap Node Connectivity

### Setup
- Multiple bootstrap nodes in different regions
- Test failover and redundancy
- Measure connection times to different geographic locations

### Test Execution
```bash
cargo run --bin ant-quic -- --bootstrap 159.89.81.21:9000,other.node:9000 --dashboard
```

### Results
⏳ **Test Pending** - Requires additional bootstrap nodes

## Summary of Phase 6 Testing

### Completed Tests
1. ✅ **Home Network NAT Traversal** - Successful connection from typical home router

### Pending Tests
2. ⏳ Mobile Network (4G/5G with carrier NAT)
3. ⏳ Enterprise Network (strict firewall/proxy)
4. ⏳ Long-running stability (1+ hour test)
5. ⏳ Multi-bootstrap redundancy

### Metrics to Track
- **Connection Success Rate**: Percentage of successful connections
- **Time to Connect**: Latency from attempt to established connection
- **Address Discovery**: Number of addresses discovered via OBSERVED_ADDRESS
- **NAT Type Detection**: Types of NATs successfully traversed
- **Stability**: Connection duration without drops
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU consumption over time

### Initial Results
| Network Type | Success Rate | Connect Time | Stability |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Home NAT     | 100% (1/1)   | < 200ms      | Stable    |
| Mobile       | Pending      | -            | -         |
| Enterprise   | Pending      | -            | -         |
| CGNAT        | Pending      | -            | -         |

### Next Steps
1. Complete mobile network testing when hotspot available
2. Find enterprise network environment for testing
3. Run overnight stability test
4. Document any failures or limitations discovered

### Current Status (2025-07-24 20:10 UTC)
- Bootstrap node on DO confirmed running (PID 334945)
- Successfully demonstrated NAT traversal from home network to cloud
- SSH connectivity to DO temporarily unavailable (network issue)
- Ready to continue testing when network access restored
