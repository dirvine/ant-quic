## 2. Test Results Summary

### 2.1 Unit Test Results
```
Total tests: 542
Passed: 530 (97.8%)
Failed: 12 (2.2%)
Ignored: 6
```

### 2.2 Failed Tests Analysis

All 12 failures relate to address observation rate limiting:

1. **Token Bucket Implementation**
   - `test_rate_limiter_from_transport_params`: Expected 25.0, got 10.0
   - Root cause: Incorrect token calculation from transport parameters

2. **Per-Path Rate Limiting**
   - `per_path_rate_limiting_independent`: Path isolation not working
   - `test_multi_path_rate_limiting`: Cross-path interference

3. **Observation Scheduling**
   - `check_for_address_observations_*`: Frame generation count mismatches
   - Expected vs actual frame counts differ

### 2.3 Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Result | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Frame processing overhead | 14ns | <50ns | ✅ Excellent |
| Memory per connection | 560 bytes | <1KB | ✅ Excellent |
| Concurrent connections | 5000+ | 1000+ | ✅ Excellent |
| Connection establishment | 42ms avg | <100ms | ✅ Excellent |
| NAT traversal success | 93% | >90% | ✅ Good |
